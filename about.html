<h1>Hi my name is Juan Baca Jimenez, I am an artist</h1>
<p class="text">Hi my name is Juan Baca Jimenez, and I am an aspiring artist born in San Jose, California. I was raised 30 minutes south of San Jose my whole life. I am a beginner in photography, painter, and recently became interested in the Digital Media Art World. I enjoy painting with acrylic paint on canvases. The themes I focus on more so are landscape, architecture, abstract paintings. I have experience in creating scupltures and throwing clay and created small scuptures and bowls so I had the chance to get my hands dirty with clay. I don't want to limit myself, so I am eager to learn different fields of Art and reach my potential.</p>
