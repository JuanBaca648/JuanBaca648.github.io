<h1>Juan Baca Jimenez | About Me</h1>
<p class="text"><span>Hi my name is Juan Baca Jimenez, and I am an aspiring multidisiplinary artist born in San Jose, California. I was raised 30 minutes south of San Jose in a small town name San Martin. Entering the world of making art officially I started with two mediums which were photography and acyrlic painting. My paintings focused on either landscape, architecture, abstract, nature, and sports as well as still life. As far as having experience with ceramics, I have created sculptures and throwing clay to make bowls. I completed my AA degree in Studio Arts at Gavilan Community College. While completing my AA at Gavilan gave me the opportunity to learn more about making physical artwork like painting, drawing, ceramics, and dipped my hands into photography. Living in the world where technology is quickly evolving I decided to shift my way to learn more about the digital aspect of making art. Since recently becoming interested in Digital Media Art once making my way in attending to San Jose State University, it was truely a life changing experience because studying Digital Media Art expanded my knowledge and how there are endless opportunities as far as creating Digital Art. The mindset I had going while attending San Jose State University was that I didn't want to limit myself, so I wanted to come in eager to learn more about the digital aspect of Art and reach my potential. Even though I will be on my way on graduating this spring of 2023, I still want to keep learning and challenging myself and stepping out of my confort zone and being willing to get my feet wet with whatever comes accross my way. </span></p>
