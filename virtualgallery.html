<h2>Description</h2>
<center>
<p class="text"><span>
For my exhibition, I imagined how I would virtually display some of the subjects I value and enjoy. I played with the lighting, color and material in my works to create thriller essences throughout my exhibition. The tree in the first image depicts my interest in nature and the intent to tackle environmental issues. The colored balls represent the times when I obsessively stared at the gumball machines and being drawn into the variety of colors of the gunballs when I was a child. The photographs of the flowers represent the importance of beauty in nature. The terrifying looking avatar carrying a shopping bag and a cell phone portrays my amusement for horror movies, being attached to my phone and the enjoyment of shopping. The assemblage of colored poles that are displayed in my exhibition was inspired by the public art installation called, "Urban Light" located in Los Angeles, California, which delineates my interest in installation art. Basically, my exhibition is a self-portrait of my personal interests.
