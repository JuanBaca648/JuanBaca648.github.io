<h2>3D Environment</h2>
<br><br>
<p class="description"> <span> My idea behind this project was to create a sports world by implementing a soccer field, baseball field, and a basketball court. I added a terrain of mountains to bring out the idea of going hiking. I included a soccer ball that is over sized that is placed over the soccer field. Also, I placed a basketall over the court, again it is oversized because I thought it would look interesting that way. Originally the ball did look like an actually basketball, but because I was exploring and playing with the edits on Sketchfab.com, I lowered the opacity and increased its glossiness and it aim to be a transparent glossy ball. I wanted to emphasize the idea and encourage to have an active lifestyle by playing sports, or exercising, hiking, yoga. Anything that will energize our minds and have a better connnection to nature and the outdoors. </span></p>

<h2> Blue Sunflower</h2>
<br><br>
<p class="description"> <span> The Blue sunflower grows automatically after a flower or plant is planted. Even works on trees and grass. The purpose of the Blue Sunflower is that is detects and indicates someone if the flower or plant is using alot of water or if it needs more water. The flower itself is small but the roots are long enough to wrap around the flower or plant that you've planted. This helps detect the amount of water the flower or plant is receiving. The blue leaves faces up if too much water is irrigated. If the leaves faces horizontally than the right amount of water is being irrigated. The leaves faces down if water is needed for your plants/flowers or even your lawn. When the leaves face horizontally, it grows seeds for birds to consume which helps improve their life span. The whole idea for this Blue Sunflower is so that we don't over irrigate our plants, trees, and our grass and waste a lot of water. The Blue Sunflower has been tested to the Plant-Biology Research Center.</span></p>
